<h1>Adaptive Resource Allocation in Multiprogramming Systems</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project demonstrates how an operating system can dynamically
        allocate CPU time and memory resources based on real-time process behaviour.
    </p>

    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Monitoring Module:</b> Observes CPU usage, memory usage, and page faults</li>
        <li><b>Decision Module:</b> Decides scheduling and memory adjustments</li>
        <li><b>Allocation Module:</b> Applies adaptive CPU and memory changes</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>CPU Scheduling</h2>
    <p>
        The system uses Dynamic Round Robin scheduling.
        Time quantum is adjusted based on whether a process is CPU-bound
        or I/O-bound, and ageing is used to prevent starvation.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Memory Allocation</h2>
    <p>
        Memory is allocated using the Working Set Model combined with
        Page Fault Frequency to avoid thrashing and memory wastage.
